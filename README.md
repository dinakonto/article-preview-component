# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

![Design preview for the Article preview component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## What is this?
This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Frontend Mentor provides great development challenges alongside beautiful designs, enabling you to build your skills using realistic projects.

This project was my first challenge. I plan to take on most, if not all, of the free challenges in order from easiest (_'Newbie'_) to hardest (_'Advanced'_).

## The challenge
__Challenge #1__
__Difficulty: Newbie__

This challenge was to build out an article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My approach
I took a mobile-first approach, completing styling and layout for a 375px viewport width first. I then built out media queries to cater to larger widths.

I used __HTML__, __CSS__ and some very basic __jQuery__ to complete the challenge.

The end product is hosted on Vercel - https://article-preview-component-flame.vercel.app/


## Questions
I came out of this challenge with a few things I wanted to change about the share options:

1. On small view, animate it in (just background-color or the whole element) on click
2. Make sure the share options popup stays fully visible even when the viewport is a bit small (e.g. stick to the right side at 880px)
3. On all sizes, clicking outside the share options element should hide it.

Would love to hear from anyone with tips on approaches! üçª
